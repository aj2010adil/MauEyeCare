## üíª Accessing the Application

### From Your Laptop
Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and go to:
**<http://localhost:5173>**

### From a Mobile or Tablet (on the same Wi-Fi)
To use the app on a mobile device, you need your laptop's Local Network (LAN) IP Address.

1.  **Find your Laptop's IP Address**:
    - The `run.ps1` script attempts to print this IP address for you when it starts.
    - Alternatively, on your laptop, open a new Terminal window, type `ipconfig`, and press Enter.
    - Look for the "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi" section and find the `IPv4 Address`. It will look something like `192.168.1.15`.

2.  **Access from Mobile**:
    - On your mobile device's web browser, type `http://` followed by the IP address and the port `:5173`.
    - Example: **`http://192.168.1.15:5173`**

> **Note**: Your mobile device and laptop must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network. If you can't connect, ensure your Wi-Fi connection is set to "Private" in Windows network settings. The setup script adds a firewall rule for this profile automatically.
